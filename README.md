I realised, that I often use the same commands or scripts.
That's why I wrote a script with a whiptail GUI, which acts like a frontent to execute some commands or scripts in the back.
The script "scripts.sh" either executes commands inside it or execeutes other scripts, which are stored inside the "install" or "update" folders.
